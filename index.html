                <h3 class="Fiona"> Fiona - Played by Emmy Rossum</h3>
                <p>Fiona is in the difficult position of being the oldest of the Gallagher children, so most of the responsibility and child-rearing falls on her young shoulders. This young woman takes it all in stride -- she's clearly been doing it for a long time. Fiona is headstrong and sure of herself in most situations, but she has a wild streak and is often her own worst enemy. </p>

                <h3 class="Frank"> Frank - Played by William H. Macy</h3>
                <p>Frank Gallagher is the proud single dad of a large brood of smart, spirited, independent kids who without him would be... perhaps better off. A hopeless addict and troublemaker, when Frank isn't at the bar spending what little money he has, he's usually passed out on the floor. Frank is constantly scheming on how to beat the system and support his addictions, and he thinks nothing of throwing his kids, or anyone else, under a bus to do so. </p>

                <h3 class="Lip"> Lip - Played by Jeremy Allen White</h3>
                <p>Short for Phillip, Lip is the second Gallagher child and by far the smartest. He is a straight A student and seems destined for big things. That is, if being a Gallagher with a penchant for breaking hearts and getting in trouble doesn't derail him first. </p>

                <h3 class=" Ib_heading"> Carl - Played by Ethan Cutkosky</h3>
                <p>Carl is the second youngest Gallagher child, and is basically nothing but trouble. He's headed down a dangerous path with a destructive streak a mile wide. But Carl remains a Gallagher, with a particular loyalty to his father. </p>

                <h3 class=" Ib_heading"> Ian - Played by Cameron Monaghan</h3>
                <p>As if being a middle Gallagher child wasn't enough, Ian is the most like his mother, which is not necessarily a good thing. He is also gay and definitely enjoys the benefits of being a cute young ginger. </p>

                <h3 class=" Ib_heading"> Debbie - Played by Emma Kenney</h3>
                <p>One of the middle Gallagher children, Debbie is helpful, sensitive, and has a good heart. She longs for familial stability and will go to great lengths to achieve it, often with disastrous results. </p>
